# Bike Sharing Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview

In this project, I performed an extensive analysis of the bike sharing dataset. The work involved data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and feature engineering. Environmental and seasonal factors were incorporated to provide insights into bike rental patterns and optimize operations.

## Data Curation and Preparation

**Data Sources:**

- Bike rental data (hourly and daily aggregations) from Capital Bikeshare.
- Weather data from freemeteo.com.

**Data Cleaning:**

- Checked for missing values and inconsistencies.
- Standardized date and time formats.
- Merged weather and rental datasets based on date and time.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Trend Analysis:**

- Visualized rental counts over time to identify seasonal and daily patterns.
- Analyzed the effect of holidays and weekends on rental activity.

**Environmental Impact:**

- Explored correlations between weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed) and bike usage.
- Assessed the impact of extreme weather events and anomalies (e.g., Hurricane Sandy).

**User Segmentation:**

- Compared rental patterns between casual and registered users.
- Investigated how user types respond differently to environmental and temporal factors.

## Results and Recommendations

**Key Findings:**

- Rental activity is highly seasonal, peaking in summer and dropping in winter.
- Weather conditions, especially temperature and precipitation, significantly affect bike usage.
- Registered users are less sensitive to weather changes compared to casual users.
- Major events and holidays cause noticeable deviations in rental patterns.

**Operational Recommendations:**

- Adjust bike availability and maintenance schedules based on weather forecasts and seasonal trends.
- Target marketing efforts to casual users during favorable weather and weekends.
- Use anomaly detection to anticipate and respond to sudden changes in demand.

## Documentation and Deliverables

**Files Produced:**

- Data curation documentation and templates.
- EDA reports and visualizations.
- Final project report summarizing methodology, analysis, and insights.
- Datafolio and dashboard for presenting key findings.

## Background

Bike sharing systems are a new generation of traditional bike rentals where the whole process from membership, rental, and return has become automatic. Through these systems, users can easily rent a bike from a particular position and return it at another position. Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world, composed of over 500,000 bicycles. These systems play an important role in traffic, environmental, and health issues.

The data generated by these systems is attractive for research. Unlike other transport services, the duration of travel, departure, and arrival positions are explicitly recorded. This feature turns bike sharing systems into a virtual sensor network for sensing mobility in the city, enabling detection of important city events via data monitoring.

## Data Set

Bike-sharing rental process is highly correlated to environmental and seasonal settings. For instance, weather conditions, precipitation, day of week, season, hour of the day, etc., can affect rental behaviors. The core data set is a two-year historical log (2011â€“2012) from Capital Bikeshare, Washington D.C., USA, publicly available at [Capital Bikeshare System Data](http://capitalbikeshare.com/system-data). Data was aggregated on hourly and daily bases, with corresponding weather and seasonal information extracted from [freemeteo.com](http://www.freemeteo.com).

## Associated Tasks

- **Regression:**
  - Prediction of bike rental count hourly or daily based on environmental and seasonal settings.
- **Event and Anomaly Detection:**
  - Count of rented bikes is also correlated to some events in the town, traceable via search engines (e.g., Hurricane Sandy). The data can be used for validation of anomaly or event detection algorithms.
